#
# Blank lines and lines beginning with '#' are ignored.  Columns need
# to be delimited by whitespace characters.  The third column needs to
# be the keyword 'allow' or 'deny'.  In most cases this file will have
# lines denying inclusion of files, but you may need to add specific
# 'allow' lines for regexp exceptions based on another rule.  The
# 'allow' or 'deny' keyword is case-insensitive.
